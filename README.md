## Installation (MultiMC)

Git clone this repository or download a release zip. Put this in your MultiMC/PolyMC/Prism instances folder. Load MultiMC and launch the newly created instance. Let it download the files, then it will open and you can have fun!

## Installation (Vanilla launcher)

Git clone or get a release zip.

Next, get [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)  
Choose "Install Client" and pick 1.19.2 as mc version and 0.14.11 as loader version.  

It will make a new instance in the launcher. Copy the mods and resourcepacks folders to the profile's folder (.minecraft/mods and .minecraft/resourcepacks respectively)  
launch the fabric 1.19.2 instance from the launcher. Now it should work.  


So have fun with this amalgamation of over 300 mods.
